	Package vanity creates a server to respond to Go package Vanity URLs. It
	converts the request URL to a VCS URL using a defined algorithm, checks if
	the target exists, and returns the redirect using the `go-import` meta
	tags, along with optional `go-source` meta tags.

	The vanity server serves *insecure* HTTP only, and is intended to be used
	behind a web server which proxies the requests to the vanity server. The
	fronting web server is responsible for terminating HTTPS connections.
